Nightly Builds
==============

Nightly builds are Android apk available at:

http://repo.domogik.org/domodroid-nightly/

They're build every night and can be build by developers at any time with a special link.

You should use the last one to be sure having last update.

To know witch version you're using, you could use the "About" menu it's write behind the rev number.

There is also the Domogik version in the exmple above 0.3

For example in this view the Dev version is 2 but it should look more like 336:9c0ad72e15 :
