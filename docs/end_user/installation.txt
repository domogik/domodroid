============
Installation
============
You need to allow unknown source

Download the last apk from http://repo.domogik.org/domodroid-nightly/ if the apps didn't work (because of nightly build) ask a working version to somebody on irc.

Just copy/paste the apk you've just download

Open it from your device and install it.

If you want to use map view, you need to put your map image (jpg , jpeg, png or svg format) in Domodroid directory.
You can also add one directly from map view
If this directory doesn't exist Domodroid will create it at first launch so that you will find it easily next time.
